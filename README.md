Eventually, a music player with voting over a LAN

INSTALLATION STEPS

1. Download a 2.7 compatible version of pymedia from here: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/
2. Install it
3. Place the music files you want to use in the same directory as the code.
4. Run the code :-)

Note: The code first converts mp3 to wavs, which are quite large in size. So keep that in mind.
